# Rejection Email Filtering from Mail Inbox using Python and Data Analysis Tools

Summary:
The project aimed to filter out rejection emails from a personal mail inbox using Python and various data analysis tools. The following steps were undertaken to accomplish the objective:

1. Data Collection: Python's `imaplib` library was utilized to establish a connection with the mail server and retrieve email data from the inbox. The library facilitated authentication and mailbox selection for subsequent operations.

2. Data Preprocessing: Tools such as Notebook on IBM Watson Studio and Pandas were employed to preprocess the raw email data. This involved cleaning, transforming, and organizing the data for further analysis.

3. Rejection Email Identification: By applying appropriate filters and criteria, the project focused on identifying rejection emails from the collected dataset. This could involve examining email subject lines, content, sender information, or any other relevant attributes specific to rejection notifications.

4. Data Analysis: Once the rejection emails were identified, data analysis techniques were applied to gain insights into the patterns and trends of rejections. This could include generating statistics, visualizations, or performing text analysis to extract meaningful information.

5. Project Outputs: The project generated valuable outputs such as visualizations depicting rejection trends over time, statistics on rejection frequency, and potentially identifying common factors contributing to rejections. These outputs could aid in understanding personal or professional experiences and inform future decision-making processes.
